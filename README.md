assets-middleware
=================

I wrote this because I didn't really need something super complex, just simple and easy to use. It relies on
`req.route.path` to ensure it's loading scripts in the right place.

### Installation

Step 1) `npm install git+https://github.com/dhigginbotham/assets-middleware --save`
Step 2) explore `/examples` folder/files
Step 3) Use like any regular middleware
